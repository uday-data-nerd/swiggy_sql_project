# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Swiggy - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Swiggy, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `swiggy_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE swiggy_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

-- 2. Creating Tables
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_item VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
);
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_name,
	dishes,
	total_orders
FROM -- table name
	(SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.customer_name,
		o.order_item as dishes,
		COUNT(*) as total_orders,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rank
	FROM orders as o
	JOIN
	customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	WHERE 
		o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 Year'
		AND 
		c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
	ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC) as t1
WHERE rank <= 5
```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 + 2 as end_time,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

**Approach 2:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql
SELECT 
	-- o.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	AVG(o.total_amount) as aov
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING  COUNT(order_id) > 750;
```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!

```sql
SELECT 
	-- o.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 100000;
```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_name,
	COUNT(o.order_id) as cnt_not_delivered_orders
FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN 
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN
deliveries as d
ON d.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE d.delivery_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

-- Approach 2
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_name,
	COUNT(*)
FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN

## Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to handle complex SQL queries and provides solutions to real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery service like Swiggy. The approach taken here demonstrates a structured problem-solving methodology, data manipulation skills, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data.

## Notice 
All customer names and data used in this project are computer-generated using AI and random functions. They do not represent real data associated with Swiggy or any other entity. This project is solely for learning and educational purposes, and any resemblance to actual persons, businesses, or events is purely coincidental.
